1 approach
    1) by using the recusion find all the permuatation
    2) then search for the given recursion and then send the next recursion
    3) if their is not next permutation then return the previous 

it has time complexity n!*n beacuse making all the permutation will take n! time


2 approach in
 c++ there is a stl in build permuatation finding function  , not in java
