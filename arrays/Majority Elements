approach 1 :  time complexity n2
    set the counter and count the number of elements in every element
    for( ....)
      { for(....)
           max (count)}
           }    and then take that count

approach 2: time complexity nlogn 
        sort the array 
        check for the first and next element 
        and then find the max count and select the index

approach 3:
